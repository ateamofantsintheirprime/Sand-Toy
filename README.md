# Sand-Toy
Simple falling sand simulator written in python, using pygame &amp; numpy. Optimised to the best of my abilities using the python profiler and pyutils' line profiler

To use the toy open terminal and enter `python3 sand_game.py`. left click to draw sand, hold space and left click to draw a wall, and hold shift and left click to remove a wall.

To benchmark the toy open terminal and enter `python3 simulator_benchmark.py`
